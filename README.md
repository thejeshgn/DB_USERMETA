# DB_USERMETA

I have a bunch of datasets as SQLITE databases. I would love these sqlite files be self contained. Hence I wanted a way to include the metadata as part of SQLITE DB itself. It would be in a table called DB_USERMETA.

DB_USERMETA is a key value table. We will have some predefined keys which can have specific values. This will also help to extract the metadata programatically.
